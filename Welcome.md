This is your new *vault*. It is based off of the **octo.brain** vault created by Zachary Hill. It's meant to be a simple and fresh start to a lightweight vault.

Make a note of something, [[create a link]], or try [the Importer](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Importer)!

When you're ready, delete this note and make the vault your own.

# Recommendations
## Just Begin
The wonderful thing about [[Obsidian]] is that it continues to evolve with you. You don't need to know how you'll use it before you use it. It's easy to move notes, enhance your organization, or completely change it up. I recommend utilize this vault for two weeks before making any significant changes.

Just begin by taking notes daily. You'll know where to evolve it after you do.

## Keep It Simple
Obsidian can be extended quite a bit with many plugins, ways of thinking, and frameworks. Youtube is full of ideas creators have around the perfect vault or the perfect process. I recommend keeping it simple. A simple system gets used.


## Use Daily Notes
Start from your daily notes. Use those as quick locations to track a topic or idea. Move that idea to a dedicated note once you realize it needs a dedicated note. It's better to track something in a daily note than think up the perfect place for that note.

## Use Tags
Tags are especially powerful in Obsidian. Use tags to help correlate similar notes together, it'll help later on when using search or understanding the relationship between notes.

## Use Templates
Templates are extremely powerful in that they help you get a note started with structure or items to fill out immediately. They also have a fantastic side effect that the more of your notes which use templates, the easier it is to find things as the structures of notes remain similar to one another. You can do powerful things such as query your notes with the same template almost like you would a database.

# Vault Structure
## \_Quick Notes
This is a good location to store a note you're not sure where it belongs. It'll end up messy over time but luckily that hardly impacts obsidian at all. I clean mine up once a month and move notes where they belong afterwards.

In a meeting and need to jot something down?

On your phone and just need to save something?
	Quick Notes
	
Have an idea but not sure where it should live?

## Daily Notes
This is where each of your daily notes gets stored. The folder structure within is automated based on year and then month. This keeps things nice and tidy.

## Dashboards
Dashboard notes or canvases go here. I keep my Tasks and Work Tasks dashboards here to begin with.

## Personal
A good location for storing personal notes. I keep the following notes and more in here:
- Financial
- Vehicles
- Gift ideas
- Problems I'm solving

## Templates
This folder stores templates which are used by Obsidian to quickly overlay a template onto your note. These are very powerful and the more templates you use the more consistent your vault will be.

## Work
A good location for storing work related notes. I keep the following notes and more in here:
- Interviews
- Meetings
- Ideas
- Strategy
- Problems to solve

# Plugins
This vault is very lightweight and only includes a single plugin installed, Tasks. Within my own vault I do have the following plugins also installed:
- Mindmap NextGen
- Table Generator

## Tasks
This plugin allow you to enter tasks quicker and aggregate them into dashboards across your entire vault based on filters you define.

Want to track your grocery list?
	Use a tag on the todo, such as #groceries and create a Tasks filter based on that.

Want to track your work tasks?
	Use a tag on the todo, such as #work . I've included a dashboard which filters based on this already as an example.
